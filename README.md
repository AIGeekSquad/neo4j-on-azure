# neo4j-on-azure

In order to implement GraphRAG or HybridRAG efficiently for Generative AI applications and architectures, a graph database is need to store and search across ontologies, entities, and relationships. 
This repo creates scripts to allow for the deployment of Neo4j standalone on an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster.

The example below shows an HybridRAG architecture. To leverage an implementation of HybridRAG, please see out our other repo: https://github.com/AIGeekSquad/MetaRAG
