# Active Context: Neo4j on Azure

## Current Focus
Project documentation and deployment script explanation.

## Recent Changes
1. Created memory bank structure with core documentation:
   - Project Brief
   - Product Context
   - System Patterns
   - Technical Context
2. Updated README.md with comprehensive documentation:
   - Project overview and AI/RAG context
   - Deployment script explanations
   - Architecture diagrams
   - Usage instructions
   - Configuration guidelines

## Active Decisions
1. **Documentation Structure**
   - Established clear separation of concerns in documentation
   - Defined key architectural patterns
   - Documented technical requirements and constraints

2. **Deployment Strategy**
   - Using Bicep for Azure resource templating
   - Implementing Helm charts for Neo4j configuration
   - Supporting multiple deployment methods (Python, PowerShell, Bash)

## Current Considerations

### Infrastructure
- Azure resource organization
- AKS cluster configuration
- Storage provisioning strategy
- Network security setup

### Deployment
- Automation script improvements
- Error handling enhancements
- Validation procedures
- Configuration management

### Operations
- Monitoring setup
- Backup strategies
- Scaling policies
- Maintenance procedures

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. Review existing deployment scripts for optimization
2. Validate Helm chart configurations
3. Test deployment processes
4. Document operational procedures

### Short Term
1. Enhance error handling in deployment scripts
2. Implement comprehensive validation checks
3. Add monitoring configurations
4. Create operational guides

### Long Term
1. Implement advanced scaling features
2. Add multi-region support
3. Enhance backup/restore capabilities
4. Develop disaster recovery procedures

## Open Questions
1. Best practices for Neo4j configuration in AKS
2. Optimal storage configuration for different workloads
3. Monitoring strategy implementation details
4. Backup/restore automation approaches

## Risk Factors
1. **Technical Risks**
   - AKS version compatibility
   - Storage performance
   - Network latency

2. **Operational Risks**
   - Deployment failures
   - Data persistence
   - Resource constraints

3. **Security Risks**
   - Access control
   - Network exposure
   - Secret management
